# Day 14: Photo albums
Create a simple single-page application that displays photos grouped by album.

#Explorer Mode

Create a photo gallery application which allows users to view their albums as well as the individual photos contained within. We'll implement this as a single page application (SPA). Use the following wireframes as layout inspiration: (include in img folder as 1.WireFrameExample.png)

* Using HTML & CSS, create the initial layouts for the SPA. Make sure you follow along with the wireframes above.
* Include any pictures you use in a directory called images.
* Now that you've built the site layout, let's use jQuery to make it dynamic. Make sure you can switch between your
List, Album & Photo views without reloading the page. Clicking an Album should load a list of the photos, and clicking the photos should open them individually full-screen for viewing.
* Make sure you have a minimum of 6 photo albums with at least 3 photos each.
